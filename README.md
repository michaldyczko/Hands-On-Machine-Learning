# Hands-On Machine Learning

This project contains multiple Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with basic usage of different machine learning techniques.

It is based mostly on material covered in **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow** by Aur√©lien Geron, but extended with my own code grouped by method types.
